# PicoyPlacaPredictor
Repository for my Software Developer Internship application for Stack Builders.

----ABOUT THE PROJECT----
The project located in the rar file is a "Pico y Placa" predictor. This project lets a user know if his or her vehicle can circulate freely in the city of Quito, according to the regulation called "Pico y Placa". This regulation prohibits the circulation of certain vehicles according to the last digit of their license plate number. The schedule established for the restriction is from 7:00 to 9:30 and from 14:00 to 19:30, and the day for each car is: 
Monday for cars whose license plate number ends in 1 or 2;
Tuesday for cars whose license plate number ends in 3 or 4; 
Wednesday for cars whose license plate number ends in 5 or 6;
Thursday for cars whose license plate number ends in 7 or 8; 
Friday for cars whose license plate number ends in 9 or 0.
All vehicles may circulate on weekends. 
The program receives from the user a license plate number, a date, and a time, and outputs an image telling the user whether the car can be on the road or not.
